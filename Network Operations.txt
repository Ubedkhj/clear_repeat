Network Operations:
Network Operations manages the daily operations of the network infrastructure that connects applications to end users, involving components like switches, routers, wireless systems, and load balancers. The technical contacts for network services are the Network Operations team, led by Kelly Hawk for North America (NA) and Kevin Killby for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). For business-related matters, Michael Viar is the main point of contact for both NA and EMEA. The support structure is divided into two groups: Network Operations, handling everyday network tasks and being the first contact for network issues, and Network Engineering, responsible for high-level design and secondary support. When a network issue is reported, it should first be investigated by the Field Support Officer (FSO) or the technical lead of the business unit or location. If confirmed as a network-related issue, it must be directed to the Global Operations Center (GOC) to ensure that Network Services is the right contact and that relevant details are collected. The GOC monitors network status through SolarWinds, creates and manages Remedy tickets, and communicates with local site contacts to check for scheduled maintenance or power issues. If no response is received within an hour or if utilities are confirmed stable, the GOC contacts the ISP and keeps requesting updates, informing Network Operations and affected users. If the ISP finds the issue to be internal, the GOC alerts the Network Operations team via email, forwarding detailed information such as who reported the issue, affected sites, troubleshooting steps, network tests, and device IP configurations. The GOC maintains communication and escalates to on-call network staff if needed, particularly after hours, following the NetOps On-Call schedule. If critical circuits in NA or EMEA experience downtime, senior leaders are notified with site details, provider information, and ticket numbers, ensuring continuous updates.


Timeblocking:
When a user cannot access their email due to a time blocking issue, this is typically because they did not submit their timesheet records on time, resulting in their access being restricted. To resolve this quickly, it's essential to contact the right team based on the time of the issue.

During North American business hours, the Directory Operations Team should be contacted via email at **giswwmessagingoperations@interpublic.com**. If the issue happens outside of business hours, check if **Ming Ng** or **Patrick Yu** are available online and notify them via chat with the user's details. If neither is available, **Tommy Poung** is another contact for Directory Operations. 

On weekends, or if none of the contacts (Ming, Patrick, or Tommy) are reachable, escalate the issue by calling the on-call staff for **Messaging Ops**, who usually resolve such issues 90% of the time. The Engineering Team or **Kirk** should no longer be contacted directly; Messaging Ops will involve Engineering if necessary.

This protocol is effective immediately, and for any questions, **Nick Delman** or **Rebecca Hale** should be contacted.
